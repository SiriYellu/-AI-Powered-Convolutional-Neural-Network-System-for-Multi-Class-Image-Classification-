This project focuses on building an intelligent system that can automatically identify common diseases found on rice leaves by analyzing simple images. Using a deep convolutional neural network, the model learns to recognize visual patterns associated with three major diseases: Bacterial Blight, Brown Spot, and Leaf Smut.
